1. **Go to Your Repository:**
   - Open your web browser and go to your GitHub repository: [https://github.com/KarrarNawazkhan/ASP](https://github.com/KarrarNawazkhan/ASP).

   This repository contains all my Android Studio projects. Each project has its own folder and includes a `README.pdf` with detailed information about the project.

   ## How to Run the Projects

   1. **Clone the Repository:**
      ```sh
      git clone https://github.com/KarrarNawazkhan/ASP.git
      cd ASP
      ```

   2. **Prepare the Project:**
      - Navigate to the project folder you want to run (e.g., `ASP/Project1`).
      - Delete all non-essential files (ZIPs, DOCXs, and PDFs):
        ```sh
        rm -f *.zip *.docx *.pdf
        ```

   3. **Open the Project in Android Studio:**
      - Open Android Studio.
      - Select "Open an existing project."(make sure that you only open folder with the name (e.g "Contacts2,2844629HW1") or delete all other zip files or .pdf files as thesse will through errors while running the app in android studio as these things are not the part of the app code)
      - Navigate to the cleaned project folder (e.g., `ASP/Project1`).
      - Open the project.

   4. **Build and Run:**
      - Let Android Studio build the project.
      - Run the project on an emulator or a physical device.
